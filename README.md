# OTmapest_1NN
Implementation of the 1-Nearest-Neighbor estimator for estimating optimal transport maps, as seen in [Plugin Estimation of Smooth Transport Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12364) (Manole et al.; 2021).

This repository uses the [Python OT (POT) package](https://pythonot.github.io/), which is easy to install.
